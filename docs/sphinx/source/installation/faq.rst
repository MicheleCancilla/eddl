Can I contribute?

Can I control the memory consumption?
-------------------------------------

Yes, we offer several memory levels to control the memory-speed trade-off. These levels are:


- ``full_mem`` (default): No memory bound (highest speed at the expense of the memory requirements)
- ``mid_mem``: Slight memory optimization (good trade-off memory-speed)
- ``low_mem``: Optimized for hardware with restricted memory capabilities.
