This specific section presents and describes the communication system of EDDL developed *ad hoc* to run training procedures in a distributed way.

## Notice

**This is very draft version, not ready to be used or tested **

**EDDL** is an open source library for Distributed Deep Learning and Tensor Operations in C++ for **CPU**, **GPU** and **FPGA**. EDDL is developed inside the DeepHealth project. For more information about DeepHealth project go to: [deephealth-project.eu](https://deephealth-project.eu/)


## EDDL communiation system scheme
